lib-c:   Generic C library for making a trivial DNS server
lib-cpp: C++ wrapper library around lib-c
src:     The zkdns server, using lib-cpp

Please note that this DNS server is trivial, and should not be public-facing,
trusted to be reliable, etc. It's purely as a convenience, eg for accessing
the HBase Master web interface.
